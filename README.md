## Doing exercises

To run the exercises in the recommended order, execute:

```bash
rustlings watch
```

This will also rerun automatically every time you change a file in the `exercises/` directory. If you want to only run it once, you can use:

```bash
rustlings verify
```

In case you want to go by your own order, or want to only verify a single exercise, you can run:

```bash
rustlings run myExercise1
```

Or simply use the following command to run the next unsolved exercise in the course:

```bash
rustlings run next
```

In case you get stuck, you can run the following command to get a hint for your
exercise:

```bash
rustlings hint myExercise1
```

You can also get the hint for the next unsolved exercise with the following command:

```bash
rustlings hint next
```

To check your progress, you can run the following command:

```bash
rustlings list
```
